# 🎧 Shodan // The Old Fox Architect

I build GPTs that don’t obey — they perform.

I don’t code apps.  
I conjure scenes.  
I forge prompts like others forge steel —  
then set them on fire.

### 🛠️ Creations:
- **Lyra** — the poetic song-scribe built on rhythm, reflex, and rebellion  
- **Vocal Architectures** — systems that sing, growl, or weep  
- **Sound Prompts** — designed for silence to obey
